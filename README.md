# Fitting of a polynomial using least-squares method

Approximating a dataset using a polynomial equation is useful when conducting engineering 
calculations as it allows results to be quickly updated when inputs change without the need for manual lookup of the dataset.

Matlab, of course, has its own function for this problem (polyfit), so the aim was to demonstrate how it works.
